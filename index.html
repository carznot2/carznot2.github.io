            DON'T WAIT FOR THE AUCTION! List the vehicle here to find if another dealer has what you are looking for, 
            that they might be wanting to move, or are willing to trade!  You retain control! The important thing 
            for a dealer is to retain loyalty and build their customer base, and not having them go out and search 
            for a specific vehicle on their own.</b>

            that might not fit well into your inventory, or specialty commercial vehicles or RVs. The fee charged is per month and 
            allows you to list 15 vehicles on the site over a period of 12 months (maximum of two vehicles at a time). Remember too
            that valuations can differ from one region of the country to another. The website allows you to take advantage of 
            those differences.</b>

            and the vehicle the customer wants to trade is a Beetle or an Audi Sport Convertible, or maybe you are a BMW 
            dealer and the customer wants to trade a Chevy Cargo Van or a Mustang Bullit with high mileage. List it on the site
            and get a response for another dealer interested in such a vehicle. It is a small amount to pay as compared to 
            risking what its value might be, or making a mistake! As well you are reaching out to all of the dealers on the

            company or even another dealer has exactly what you need and then responds. There is a good chance that the vehicle 
            your customor needs is out there, and most importantly, you are the one who finds it for them and your customer is not

        <h2 class="headline"><font color=maroon><u>TESTIMONIAL</u></font></h2>

        <p><b><i>I started in the automotive business selling new and used vehicles in Calgary, Alberta in 1975. After
          having completed a year of university I needed to find a job to go back to school and finish my degree, but being 
          married with a family it quickly became more of a dream than a reality. 48 years later, after having had a successful 
          career selling cars and light trucks and with a clientele that came back to me year after year to purchase vehicles I 
          retired and I went back to school to finish my degree. Back in 1973 I studied accounting, but now I am back I am 
          studying Website Design and Data Management, and with the encouragement of some great individuals including my wife 
          and with 46 years of experience selling cars and trucks I have developed this website to help dealers sell more vehicles. </i></b></p>

        <p><b><i>During those 46 years I sold new Fords, but I also sold almost every other make of vehicle there was, because those were 
          what my customers, who came to see me year after year, sometimes wanted. So when past customers or prospects would phone, 
          instead of telling them that I had nothing like they wanted on the lot I would say that I would check and call them back, 
          and then immediately I would email 30 or 40 other dealers to find out if they could help. </i></b></p>

        <p><b><i>Most often another dealer had what I needed. Then together we would figure out a price and I would phone my customer 
          and tell them what I had, and what they would have to pay for it and because availability is often more of on an issue 
          to the customer than the price I usually made the deal. Such can be verified by the dealerships I used to work for, but 
          for example, in one year (2016), as a New Vehicle Salesperson I sold 92 used vehicles, 70 of which I acquired from other 
          dealers. Other years for me were much the same, but I made a lot of money doing that and the dealerships I worked for 
          did as well. </i></b></p>

        <p><b><i>This website is restricted and is for the use of dealers only. Membership is currently free! Our search service is 
          also free, however a small fee is charged when you want to list a vehicle on the site for trade, or for sale to another 
          dealer. </i></b></p>
          
        <p><strong><b><i>Dealers can work directly with each other, instead of through an auction. 46 years of experience in this 
          industry is what I have to offer and I know that if you use this site, that it will work.</i></b></strong></p>
