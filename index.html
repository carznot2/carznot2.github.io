            List the vehicle you need right here on the website to find out if another dealer has or knows where you might find one!  
            Maybe another dealer has something that they might be interested in moving from their inventory, or they are willing to trade 
            for something you might have!  Whatever the situation, YOU RETAIN CONTROL! The important thing for you is to retain customer 
            loyalty and build upon your customer base, and not have customers or prospects going out and searching for a vehicle 
            on their own, either retail or even at another dealer!</i></big>

            that might not fit well into your inventory, or specialty commercial vehicles or RVs. The fee charged is per month and 
            allows you to list 15 vehicles on the site over a period of 12 months (maximum of two vehicles at a time). Remember too
            that valuations can differ from one region of the country to another. The website allows you to take advantage of 
            those differences.</i></big>

            dealer and the customer wants to trade a Chevy Cargo Van or a Mustang Bullit with high mileage. List it on the site
            and get a response for another dealer interested in such a vehicle. It is a small amount to pay as compared to 
            risking what its value might be, or making a mistake! As well you are reaching out to all of the dealers on the

            Then you go onto the website, and do a SEARCH. Maybe a leasing company, or a rental company or even another dealer has 
            exactly what you need and then responds. There is a good chance that the vehicle your customer needs is out there, and 
            most importantly, you are the one who finds it for them and your customer is not checking around with other dealers!

        <h2 class="headline"><font color=maroon><u><big><i><mark>TESTIMONIAL</mark></i></big></u></font></h2>

        <p><big><font color=navy>My name is George Shaw. I started in the automotive business selling new and used vehicles in Calgary, 
          Alberta in 1975.</font></big></p> 
          
          <p><big><font color=navy>After having completed just a year of university I needed to find a job so as to be able to go back to 
          school and finish my degree, but being married with a family made things more of a dream than a reality. Now, 48 years later, after 
          having had a successful career selling cars and light trucks and with a clientele that came back to me year after year to purchase 
          vehicles I retired and I went back to school to finish my degree. Back then I studied accounting, but now I am studying Website 
          Design and Data Management, and with the encouragement of some great individuals including my wife and with 46 years 
          of experience selling cars and trucks I have developed this website to help dealers sell more vehicles.</font></big></p>

        <p><big><font color=navy>During those 46 years I sold new Fords, but I also sold almost every other make of vehicle there was, because 
          those were what my customers wanted. So when past customers or prospects would phone, instead of telling them that I 
          had nothing like they wanted on the lot I would say that I would check and call them back, and then immediately 
          I would email 30 or 40 other dealers to find out if they could help.</font></big>></p>

        <p><big><font color=navy>Most often another dealer had what I needed. Then together we would figure out a price and I would phone my customer 
          and tell them what I had, and what they would have to pay for it and because availability is often more of an issue 
          to the customer than price I usually made the deal. Such can be verified by the dealerships I used to work for, but as 
          an example, in one year (2016), as a New Vehicle Salesperson I sold 92 used vehicles, 70 of which I acquired from other 
          dealers. Other years for me were much the same, but I made a lot of money doing that and the dealerships I worked for 
          did as well. You can do the same!</font></big></p>

        <p><big><font color=navy>This website is restricted and is for the use of dealers only. Right now Membership is free and dealers can  
          work directly with each other, instead of going through an auction. 46 years of experience in this industry is what I have 
          to offer and I know that if you use this site, that it will work.</font></big></strong></p>
