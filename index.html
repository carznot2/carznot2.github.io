        <h2 class="headline"><font color=maroon><u><big><i><mark>TESTIMONIAL</mark></i></big></u></font></h2>

        <p><big><font color=navy>My name is George Shaw. I started in the automotive business selling new and used vehicles in Calgary, 
          Alberta in 1975.</font></big></p> 
          
          <p><big><font color=navy>After having completed just a year of university I needed to find a job so as to be able to go back to 
          school and finish my degree, but being married with a family made things more of a dream than a reality. Now, 48 years later, after 
          having had a successful career selling cars and light trucks and with a clientele that came back to me year after year to purchase 
          vehicles I retired and I went back to school to finish my degree. Back then I studied accounting, but now I am studying Website 
          Design and Data Management, and with the encouragement of some great individuals including my wife and with 46 years 
          of experience selling cars and trucks I have developed this website to help dealers sell more vehicles.</font></big></p>

        <p><big><font color=navy>During those 46 years I sold new Fords, but I also sold almost every other make of vehicle there was, because 
          those were what my customers wanted. So when past customers or prospects would phone, instead of telling them that I 
          had nothing like they wanted on the lot I would say that I would check and call them back, and then immediately 
          I would email 30 or 40 other dealers to find out if they could help.</font></big>></p>

        <p><big><font color=navy>Most often another dealer had what I needed. Then together we would figure out a price and I would phone my customer 
          and tell them what I had, and what they would have to pay for it and because availability is often more of an issue 
          to the customer than price I usually made the deal. Such can be verified by the dealerships I used to work for, but as 
          an example, in one year (2016), as a New Vehicle Salesperson I sold 92 used vehicles, 70 of which I acquired from other 
          dealers. Other years for me were much the same, but I made a lot of money doing that and the dealerships I worked for 
          did as well. You can do the same!</font></big></p>

        <p><big><font color=navy>This website is restricted and is for the use of dealers only. Right now Membership is free and dealers can  
          work directly with each other, instead of going through an auction. 46 years of experience in this industry is what I have 
          to offer and I know that if you use this site, that it will work.</font></big></strong></p>
