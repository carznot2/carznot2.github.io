          <h2 class="headline"><font color=maroon><u><big><i><mark></mark></i></big></u></font>Testimonial</h2>

        <p><big><font color=navy>My name is George Shaw. &nbsp;I started in the automotive business selling new and used vehicles in Calgary, 
          Alberta in 1975. After having completed just a year of university I needed to find a job so as to be able to go back to 
          school and finish my degree, but being married with a family made things more of a dream than a reality. <br><br>
          Now, 48 years later, after having had a successful career selling cars and light trucks I retired and went back to school to 
          finish my degree.<br><br> 
          Back then I studied accounting, but now I am studying Website Design and Data Management, and with the encouragement of some great 
          individuals including my wife and with 46 years of experience selling cars and trucks I have developed this website to help dealers 
          sell more vehicles.<br><br>
          During those 46 years I sold new Fords, but I also sold almost every other make of vehicle there was, because 
          when past customers or prospects would phone, instead of telling them that I had nothing like what they wanted on the lot 
          I would tell them I would check and call them back, and then immediately I would email 30 or 40 other dealers to find out if they 
          could help.<br><br>
          Most often another dealer had what I needed and then together we would figure out a price and I would phone my customer 
          and tell them what I had, and what they would have to pay for it and I usually made the deal. &nbsp;Such can be verified by the 
          dealerships I worked for, but in one year for example, in 2016, while working as a New Vehicle Salesperson and 
          focusing on selling new cars and trucks, I also sold 92 used vehicles, 70 of which I acquired from other dealers. <br><br>
          Other years for me were much the same, but as a new vehicle salesperson I also made a lot of money selling used cars and trucks, 
          and the dealerships I worked for did as well!<br><br>
        </font></big></p>
        <p><big><font color=darkred>PLEASE NOTE: This website is restricted and is for the use of AUTOMOTIVE DEALERS ONLY. &nbsp;Its purpose is to
          allow dealers to work directly with each other, instead of going through an auction. &nbsp;46 years of experience in this industry 
          is what I have to offer. &nbsp;Give it a chance and this tool might be the best you ever had!</font></big></strong></p>
